# key_mappings
My config files for the way i like my keyboards set up

<img src="./images/apple_keyboard.png?raw=true " width="300">
<img src="./images/usb_hid.png?raw=true " width="300">  

Having accessibility turned on for iterm2 seems to break the spectacle ctrl+alt left/right settings...

__TODO__  
* See if 'defaults' can help me eg `defaults read org.pqrs.Karabiner.plist` it has some import/export features rather than just replacing the files on install
