__TODO__
* Exclude sublime from home/end bindings and do it manually in the keybindings. This is so ctrl+shift+home/end will work instead of swapping lines
* use karabiner to handle swapping of modifier keys so we dont have to do it in the OS.
* Get more than just key bindings - include all sublime preferences
* Look at putting key modifiers back to default and using karabiner PC settings instead
* Include karabiner private.xml when necessary
